# API3 Bounties: Total of $3000 
We are pleased to share that API3 will be offering a total of $3000 USD value in API3 tokens

API3 dAPI price feeds and OEV are available on 37 chains across the EVM ecosystem.

### :trophy: Best implementation of the OEV network liquidator or liquidation tools: Up to $3000 API3 between a max of 6 winners 

- ðŸ¥‡ 2 times $1000 per team (Utilizing API3's OEV)
- ðŸ¥ˆ 4 times $250 per team (Utilizing API3 Price Feeds)

We are looking for projects that
- 1 - Enhance the OEV searcher experience with dashboards
- - Build a dashboard that monitors health positions of borrowers that filters with positions near health of 1.0
- - Utilize this [script](https://github.com/api3dao/oev-searcher-starter) to update a price oracle on the dashboard
- 2 -  utilize an API3 oracles to create a real-world use case for our price feeds in smart contracts within DeFi.

- 3 - Bots that run liquidations using OEV

# Introduction to API3
First-party oracles provide a more secure and reliable oracle, whilst enabling dApps to verify the data source. API3's first-party oracles are powered by Airnode, a serverless oracle node that enables API providers to run their own oracle nodes.

### OEV
Oracle Extractable Value

- The ability to allow users/searchers to bid for the right to update an price feed before the oracle is scheduled to update.
Learn more about OEV [Here](https://docs.api3.org/reference/oev-network/).

Price Feed Dashboard tool: https://centurion.web.app/


### Data feeds: dAPIs
dAPIs provide smart contracts with access to continuously updated feeds of market data by oracles hosted by highly reputable financial data providers.

- Managed dAPIs are powered by multiple first-party oracles with native-chain aggregation offering a verifiable, decentralized oracle solution.
Once a dAPI has been integrated a smart contract can access a range of data feed services through the [API3 Market](https://market.api3.org/dapis).

## Submission Requirements

All hackathon participants who are competing for the API3 bounties are required to submit a project that meets the following requirements:

- The project should be submitted to the Encode Club London Hackathon 2024 by the deadline.
- Use of API3â€™s dAPIs that facilitates a proper use-case.
- The project should be deployed on a testnet/mainnet (No local tests)
- OEV does NOT have testnet, only mainnets
- The project should be open-source with a public Github repository with the codebase. 
- The repo must be licenced with one of the following open source licences: GPL-3.0, or MIT.

# Judging criteria
Participants may submit a maximum of 1 project by the hackathon deadline. After submission, projects will be judged by the following criteria:

- **Real-world Functionality**: How well does the project work? Does it meet the minimum requirements?

- **Technical Difficulty**: How technically challenging was it to build the project?

- **Originality**: How original is the idea? How much does it differ from other existing solutions?
